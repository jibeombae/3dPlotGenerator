commit_message = """depends: Exclude more unix/Linux graphical interface libraries (#5132)

These usually come with the graphical stack,
including them may cause unexpected issues.

The first regex picks up everything that comes out of `libglvnd`
(https://github.com/NVIDIA/libglvnd,
https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/focal/libglvnd),
a total of 7 libraries.
The second one is for the DRM Linux kernel interface library.

Partially-fixes: #4951
